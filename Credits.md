## VesselPositions
[VesselPositions](https://github.com/godarklight/VesselPositions), which allowed me to obtain the position and velocity of every vessel in realtime.

## Telemachus Reborn
Without [Telemachus Reborn](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179887-telemachus-reborn-ksp-v15x-17x/)'s map, I likely would have never made this plugin.

## Kerbal Maps
[Kerbal Maps](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/23154-022-kerbal-maps-web-maps-of-all-bodies-biomes-and-text-info-v011-oct-8/) for the map, which both Telemachus and this plugin uses.

## Temporary Kerbal Maps
[Temporary Kerbal Maps](https://ksp.deringenieur.net/). Without this backup, the Telemachus map would not have worked and would likely have been removed, resulting in this plugin never being made.
